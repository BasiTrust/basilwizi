          span.pink The Mandate
        p.sub-tittle.mt-3.mb-4 Zambezi Valley in general, remain one of the least developed areas in the country, highly vulnerable and chronically food insecure due to external shocks such as drought and crop failure causing annual food shortages, particularly among the poorest and most vulnerable households. Among the underplaying causes of poverty in the Zambezi valley are lack of pro-poor policies and/ or ineffective implementation of exiting policy. Therefore, Basilwizi’s work is still relevant and has potential of accomplishing its mission in light of the current political dispensation in Zimbabwe.
